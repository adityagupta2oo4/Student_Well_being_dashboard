# üß† MindTrack Student Well-being Dashboard

MindTrack is a dual-interface web application designed to help students monitor their academic performance (CGPA) and lifestyle factors (Sleep, Study Time, Stress, etc.). It calculates a composite **Risk Probability** and provides actionable alerts. The system features a Student Dashboard for personal data input and visualization, and an Admin Dashboard for holistic campus-wide risk monitoring.

## üåü Features

### Student Dashboard (Frontend)
* **Daily Data Input:** Students can input their current CGPA, Sleep, Stress, Study Time, Social Time, and Exercise.
* **Real-time Risk Calculation:** A composite risk score (0-100%) is calculated instantly based on input parameters and established thresholds.
* **Metric Cards:** Displays current key metrics like CGPA, Avg Sleep, and Stress.
* **Visualizations:** Features a **Lifestyle Radar Chart** to visualize the balance between different life factors.
* **Theme Toggle:** Includes a modern **Dark Mode** toggle with a sleek SVG switch.

### Admin Dashboard (Monitoring)
* **Aggregate Metrics:** Displays average CGPA, Attendance, Stress Score, and Sleep across the student body.
* **Trend Analysis:** Uses Line Charts (Yearly CGPA Trend) and Bar Charts (Attendance Trend) to monitor overall student performance.
* **Predictive Risk Table:** Lists flagged students based on their computed risk score, suggesting immediate actions (e.g., "Refer to counselor").
* **Correlation Charts:** Includes charts like **Sleep vs CGPA** (Scatter plot) and **Stress vs Sleep** (Bubble chart) to identify campus-wide well-being patterns.

    * **Login Page:** `[root]/Login-Page/index.html`
    * **Student Dashboard:** `[root]/Frontend/Dash-Board/student/index.html` (Requires logging in first)

3.  **Start a Local Server (Recommended):**
    For optimal loading and script execution, especially if you have a complex file structure, it's best to run a simple local web server:
    * **Using VS Code:** Install the "Live Server" extension and right-click `Login-Page/index.html` to "Open with Live Server".
    * **Using Python:** Run `python -m http.server` in the project root directory and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
